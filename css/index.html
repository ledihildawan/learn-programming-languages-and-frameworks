  <h2>Chicken Vindaloo</h2>
  <p>
    “Vindaloo” is a popular Indian <a href="">curry dish</a> that calls for meat
    to be marinated in a highly flavorful spicy mixture with vinegar, then
    quickly cooked up when you’re ready to eat.
  </p>
  <p>
    While this dish has a long list of spices, most are quite common in the
    average spice rack. If you find you're missing one, it's not a deal breaker.
    You will still have a lovely, fragrant curry.
